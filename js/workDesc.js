I drew one concept, 'Rebirth' from three keywords, 'Reinvigorate', 'Reposition', and 'Refresh', and I made all creative decisions based on three words, 'Life', 'Space', and 'Light'.

First, the 3D part uses color mapping to create a car animation, and then to create a 15 second image using effects and effects in aftereffect. Based on this, I made a homepage design and production including the following functions. 1)Colour Selector to change car colour. 2)Detailed hover states/overlays highlighting vehicle details. 3)Use of GreenSock or CSS3 Animation/Transitions as needed. 4)App should be responsive and display in different ways for mobile and desktop. 5)Car video must play first then, load application. The homepage tried to achieve a color balance as a whole and made a balanced design using the design principle. -Noverber 12nd, 2016",

		text : "This is a group project that only collaborates with the basic design, and the overall situation is individual. The shape of the logo is based on the heart shape and I tried to capture the curiosity of the cat. The colors were designed using colors that would appeal to those who use soft colors. By using the principle of design, it is possible to be vertically symmetrical as a whole. I tried to make the design of the business card as simple as possible using the shape and color of the logo.-February 15th, 2016",
